Write real tests for functions we lazily marked [no-test]
CHANGES:
1. Create tests/app_tests.rs - scroll_timeline, handle_click, view switching
2. Create tests/treemap_tests.rs - truncate_path, compute_treemap_layout
3. Create tests/git_tests.rs - format_oid, restore workflow in temp repo
4. Update src/views/treemap.rs - expose truncate_path and compute_treemap_layout as pub
5. Update src/git_ops.rs - already pub, just needs tests
